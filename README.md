## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Query


### What I learned

From this project I learned about media query and I also learnd that how can you use ::before and ::after css selectors. I created responsive navbar using html,css and javascript which was new for me.  

### Continued development

I am still confused about media query so i am looking forward to learn more about it.
